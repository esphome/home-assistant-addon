      For example to test a pull request, use `pull/XXXX/head` where `XXXX` is
      the PR number, or you can specify the username of the fork owner and
      branch `username:branch` which assumes the repository is named `esphome`
      still.

      If you need to test the latest commit on dev branch before the image is
      updated you can enter `dev` here.

      Please note that the fork or branch you are using **must** be up to
      date with ESPHome dev or the add-on **will not start**.
  home_assistant_dashboard_integration:
    name: Home Assistant Dashboard Integration
    description: >-
      Enables/Disables the ESPHome dashboard integrating with Home Assistant
      for automatic configuration of devices and device updates. If you use
      multiple version of the ESPHome add-on, make sure it is enabled on a
      single add-on only.
  keyfile:
    name: Private key file
    description: >-
      The private key file to use for SSL. Note that this file must
      exist in the /ssl/ folder.
  leave_front_door_open:
    name: Disable external authentication
    description: >-
      Disables external authentication when having opened the add-on
      on an external port. **WARNING**: This is a security risk!
  relative_url:
    name: Relative URL
    description: >-
      Host the ESPHome dashboard under a relative URL, so that it can be
      integrated into existing web proxies like NGINX under a relative URL.
      Defaults to `/`.

      Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.
  status_use_ping:
    name: Use ping for status
    description: >-
      By default the dashboard uses mDNS to check if nodes are online. This does
      not work across subnets unless your router supports mDNS forwarding
      or avahi. Enabling this option will use ICMP ping to check if nodes are
      online.
  streamer_mode:
    name: Streamer mode
    description: >-
      Enables/Disables streamer mode, which makes ESPHome hide all
      potentially private information. So for example WiFi (B)SSIDs (which could
      be used to find your location), usernames, etc.
network:
  6052/tcp: Web interface (to use without Home Assistant)
